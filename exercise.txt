# What is a terminal?

To my understanding, when I think of a terminal, I also think about the difference between a terminal
and a GUI. For a GUI, we utilize icons, mouse, and buttons to interact with our devices and software To
have them do what we need them to do. However, when using a terminal we utilize command line interface (CLI)
to interact with our computer and give it commands to directly tell it what to do and operate on a more
deeper and internal level compared to GUI. For example, if I want to create a repo and upload files,
from a GUI route, I can go directly to the website and click on the buttons on the site to create a repo and
upload files via the site. But, with the terminal, I can give it commands such as mkdir, cd, code, touch, git init,
to directly "talk" to my computer and allow it to make the necessary changes and steps to do what I need done.


# Differences between Git and GitHub?

The best analogy that helps me understand the difference between Git and GitHub, that I read once, is that
Git is a wallet and GitHub is the bank. Git is version control system that can track changes, manage your content,
make changes, and runs locally on your computer, just like how a wallet is local to you and belongs to you
and you can track what is inside, and what you put in and take out. GitHub is an web-based platform where
multiple people can upload, store and share their repositories with others just like how a bank/ATM stores
that and you can access that "bank" from your phone (virtual wallet in this scenario) and deposit money in that
"bank."


# How to fork a repo?

On GitHub, go to the repo that you wish to fork and on that page, there should be a fork button that you can click.
The owner will be yourself if you are the one working on it. If there is any changes you want to make in this
section to distinguish it from the original for you, do so. Then click create fork. Then, we will clone the
repo with Git. In your fork, we will copy the SSH code associated with this repo. Open the terminal, git clone [SSH],
if you are using anything else other than SSH that requires you to update the info to your personal email, username, or account
do so, and once you clone the repo and click Enter, it should be ready to work on.
